# Octoprint/Mainsail Uploader
A small Windows background application for automatically uploading gcode (or .stl) files to Octoprint/Marlin from Simplify3d, Cura, or Superslicer. Basically you point it to a folder on a windows workstation and any gcode or stl files you copy to the folder will automatically get uploaded (and optionally printed) via REST. This works really well with Simplify3d's "Save Toolpaths to Disk" or Superslicer's Export G-code features.
